# Linear-list-of-data-structure
## Data structure | Linear list
Language: C
> The repository includes:
* 2 source files
* 2 input_txt (for testing the source code)
* 1 demmand for the code (in Chinese; complete requirement for the tasks)

There are 2 tasks concerning **linear list** :
1. Write an `algorithm`: Insert the element X into the proper position in the **order list**
2. Write an `algorithm`: Reverse the **singly linked list** using the storage space of the origin list


### Preview:
Insert the element X into the proper position in the order list

Write an algorithm: Reverse the singly linked list using the storage space of the origin list

This project is my assignment for the course Data Structure when I was a first-year student at :blue_book: [the Department of Electrical Engineering at South China University of Technology](http://www.scut.edu.cn/ee/). I really appreciate the guidance and help from my teacher Dr. Qin, along with my classmates.:bowtie:
